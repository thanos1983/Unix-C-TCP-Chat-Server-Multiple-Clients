# Unix-C-TCP-Chat-Server-Multiple-Clients
TCP Server able to operate with multiple Clients "Customized Behavior"

The Client and Server both are designed to be non blocking with SELECT System call.

To initialize the script first you need to execute the 'make' command on shell.

CAUTION: Some of the functions will only work on UNIX OS, I am not sure if the script
will work/compile on Windows OS.

If you have any problems with script please do not hesitate to come in contact with me.
